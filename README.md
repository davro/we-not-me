## WE RSI Background Indicator
The RSI Background Indicator is working as follow
* When the price starts being overbought, a red slightly transparent background will show up.
* When the price is overbought, the background becomes less transparent
* When the price starts being oversold, a green slightly transparent background will show up.
* When the price is oversold, the background becomes less transparent
### Example of oversold price

### Example of a divergence
When the price is overbought, but the price keeps increasing, it is a sign of a divergence. Mind the reversal !
