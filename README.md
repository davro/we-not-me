## WE Indicator 

The WE indicator is the first indicator or three, the other two are called **Angel** and **Alpha**.
This is the fundamental starting point of this rapidly growing project, this project was initially started to develop a Macro Investment plan, this project brings together many different techniques into on project that will run on Tradingview using the pine programming language and is designed and programmed to effecient that it will run on the free account until, and then eventually WE will have more indicators once we develop into Tradingview paid plans, but the initial goal is to keep the barrier to entry for new investors and traders to a minimum.

# RSI Background 
The RSI Background Indicator is working as follow
* When the price starts being overbought, a red slightly transparent background will show up.
* When the price is overbought, the background becomes less transparent
* When the price starts being oversold, a green slightly transparent background will show up.
* When the price is oversold, the background becomes less transparent
* When the price is overbought and the MACD is identifying some reversal, the background becomes orange
    * ONLY EFFECTIVE IN A BULL RUN, ISN'T EFFICIENT IN ACCUMULATION / BEAR PHASE

### Example of oversold price

### Example of a divergence
When the price is overbought, but the price keeps increasing, it is a sign of a divergence. Mind the reversal !
