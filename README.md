## WE Indicator 

The WE indicator is the first indicator of three, the other two indicators are called **Angel** and **Alpha**, the free version of [Tradingview](https://www.tradingview.com) only allows three indicators to be run simultaneously,  but more WE indicators and studies will be implemented once WE expand beyond the initial development phase but keeping these three indicator being able to run on a free trading view account is an important part of the project.

This is the fundamental starting point of this rapidly growing project, this project was initially started to develop a Macro Investment plan, and brings together many different techniques into one project that runs on Tradingview using the pine programming language and is designed and programmed to efficient enough that it will run on the free account until WE have more indicators and develop into Tradingview paid plans, but the goal is to keep the barrier to entry for new investors and traders to an absolute minimum.

# WE-INDICATOR
# PI Cycle
Pi Cycle is a very useful indication of when the market is very overheated, so overheated that the shorter term moving average, which is the 111 day moving average, has reached a x2 multiple of the 350 day moving average. 
Historically it has proved advantageous to sell Bitcoin at this time in Bitcoin's price Cycle

# Tom Demark
The WE indicator has an implementation of the TD Sequential with the we-indicator, but eventually WE plan on implementing more studies relating to the Tom DeMark 

Tom DeMark, is used by many of the top money managers of all time, the DeMARK Indicators on heavily used on Bloomberg  it's an approach to those seeking a deeper, more comprehensive understanding of the market, these are not 'technical' indicators in the conventional sense rather market timing tools that are compatible with fundamental analysis.

# RSI Background 
The RSI Background Indicator is working as follow
* When the price starts being overbought, a red slightly transparent background will show up.
* When the price is overbought, the background becomes less transparent
* When the price starts being oversold, a green slightly transparent background will show up.
* When the price is oversold, the background becomes less transparent
* When the price is overbought and the MACD is identifying some reversal, the background becomes orange
    * ONLY EFFECTIVE IN A BULL RUN, ISN'T EFFICIENT IN ACCUMULATION / BEAR PHASE

### Example of oversold price

### Example of a divergence
When the price is overbought, but the price keeps increasing, it is a sign of a divergence. Mind the reversal !

### Example of overbought + MACD potential reversal (BULL RUN ONLY)
